# 6.03 Activity 3

- What is the difference between `INDEX()` and `RANK()`?

Index returns a number corresponding to the row's position on the list. Rank evaluates and sorts the data on some condition and assigns a number based on the row's position on this evaluation.

- In the plot from the previous activity, create a calculated field `index` using the `index()` function. Create another calculated field `rank` defined as `RANK(SUM([Profit]))`. Through the `rank` calculated field, we will try to rank the data based on the total profit values.
- Add `index` calculated field at the end in rows section.
- Now add `rank` calculated field at the end in rows section.
- Your plot would look like this - check the link to the [public Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/himanshu.aggarwal2552#!/vizhome/6_3_activity3_solution/Sheet12?publish=yes).
- Observe the difference between `index` and `rank`.
